The primary difference between horizontal scaling and vertical scaling is that 
horizontal scaling involves adding more machines or nodes to a system, 
while vertical scaling involves adding more power (CPU, RAM, storage, etc.) to an existing machine. In other words, horizontal scaling involves scaling out, while vertical scaling involves scaling up. Horizontal scaling is typically used to handle increasing amounts of traffic or workload, while vertical scaling is typically used to handle resource-intensive tasks or applications that require more processing power.


horizontal scaling
Pros:

Easier Scaling from Hardware additions
Enhanced Flexibility
Lesser Downtime
Offers Redundancy
Cons: 

Higher initial costs involved
Harder to maintain 

vertical scaling
Pros:

Cost Effective
Less Complexity involved
Easier to maintain
Cons: 

More Downtime possibilities
Very less flexibility
Single Point of Failure
