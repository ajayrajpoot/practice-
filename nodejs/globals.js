/**
 Node.js Global Objects are the objects that are available in all modules. Global Objects are built-in objects that are part 
 of the JavaScript and can be used directly in the application without importing any particular module. The Node.js 
 Global Objects are listed below: 

 The global object in Node. js is called 'global'. It provides access to several built-in objects, including 'process', 'console', 'buffer', 'setImmediate()', 'clearImmediate()', and 'setTimeout()', etc.

Globals are of three parts among them
one is global ,( eg -- setInterval, clearInterval, console,setImmediate, clearImmediate)
another is process and  (eg. process)
the third one is buffer  (eg-- buffer)

so the first one globa; is namesspece object whih acts
as a container for all other global 
objects so if we goto this example and 
run the debugger we can see here we had 
global object which  contains like array


Process is also a global object but 
it makes or turns asynchronouse function
have used process dot next tick tp convert a synchronous function to an asynchronous
callback there are other usage also ;like process
