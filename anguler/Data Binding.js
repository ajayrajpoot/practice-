6. What is Data Binding ?
    Data binding is a process that enables users to manipulate web page elements through a web browser.
    It employs dynamic HTML and does not require complex scripting or programming. Data binding is used in web pages that include interactive components, 
    such as calculators, tutorials, forums, and games. It also enables a better incremental display of a web page when pages contain a large amount of data. 

    Angular uses the two-way binding. The model state reflects any changes made in the corresponding UI elements. 
    Conversely, the UI state reflects any changes in the model state. This feature enables the framework to connect the DOM to the model data through the controller.

    

3. What is data binding? Which type of data binding does Angular deploy?
    Data binding is a phenomenon that allows any internet user to manipulate Web page elements using a Web browser. It uses dynamic HTML and does not require complex scripting or programming. We use data binding in web pages that contain interactive components such as forms, calculators, tutorials, and games. Incremental display of a webpage makes data binding convenient when pages have an enormous amount of data. 

    Angular uses the two-way binding. Any changes made to the user interface are reflected in the corresponding model state. Conversely, any changes in the model state are reflected in the UI state. This allows the framework to connect the DOM to the Model data via the controller. However, this approach affects performance since every change in the DOM has to be tracked.
