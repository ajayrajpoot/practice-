8. What are decorators in Angular? 
    Decorators are a design pattern or functions that define how Angular features work. They are used to make prior modifications to a class,
    service, or filter. Angular supports four types of decorators, they are:

    1. Class Decorators , such as @Component and @NgModule
    2. Property Decorators, such as @Input and @Output
    3. Method Decorators, such as @HostListener
    4. Parameter Decorators, such as @Inject

    Decorator that marks a class as an Angular component and provides configuration metadata that determines how the component should be processed, instantiated, and used at runtime.
