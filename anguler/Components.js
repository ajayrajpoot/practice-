10. What are Components in Angular?
    Components are the basic building blocks of the user interface in an Angular application. Every component is associated with a template 
    and is a subset of directives. An Angular application typically consists of a root component, which is the AppComponent, that then branches out 
    into other components creating a hierarchy.
