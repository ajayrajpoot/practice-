4. What are Single Page Applications (SPA)?
    Single-page applications are web applications that load once with new features just being mere additions to the user interface. It does not load new HTML pages to display the new page's content, instead generated dynamically. This is made possible through JavaScript's ability to manipulate the DOM elements on the existing page itself. A SPA approach is faster, thus providing a seamless user experience.
