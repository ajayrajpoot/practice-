/**
 * In TypeScript, a module is a way to organize code into reusable, self-contained units of code that can be imported and exported between different parts of an application. Modules can contain classes, functions, interfaces, and other code, and can be either internal to a project or external libraries.
To use a module in TypeScript, you need to define it using the export keyword, which makes its members available to other parts of the application. You can then import the module using the import keyword, which allows you to use its members in your code.
Here is an example of how to define and use a module in TypeScript:

 // myModule.ts
export function myFunction() {
  // code here
}

export class MyClass {
  // code here
}
In this example, we define a module called myModule that exports a function called myFunction and a class called MyClass. The export keyword makes these members available outside of the module.
To use the members of the myModule module in another file, you can import them using the import keyword:

 // main.ts
import { myFunction, MyClass } from "./myModule";

myFunction();
const myInstance = new MyClass();
In this example, we import the myFunction function and MyClass class from the myModule module using destructuring. We can then call the myFunction function and create an instance of the MyClass class, both using the imported names.
There are different ways to import and export modules in TypeScript, such as importing all members using the * as syntax, importing default exports, or using aliases for imported members. It is important to understand the different syntaxes and their implications, depending on the size and complexity of the project.
Using modules can help you write more modular and maintainable code in TypeScript, by isolating functionality and reducing naming conflicts. However, it is important to use them judiciously and not to create too many small modules, which can increase the complexity of the codebase.
