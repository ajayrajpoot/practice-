2. What is TypeScript?
    TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that offers excellent consistency. It is highly recommended, as it provides some syntactic sugar and makes the code base more comfortable to understand and maintain. Ultimately, TypeScript code compiles down to JavaScript that can run efficiently in any environment. 

     TypeScript defines a set of types to JavaScript, which helps users write JavaScript code that is easier to understand. 
    All of the TypeScript code compiles with JavaScript and can run smoothly on any platform. TypeScript is not compulsory for developing an Angular application. 
    However, it is highly recommended as it offers better syntactic structureâ€”while making the codebase easier to understand and maintain. 
    
    npm install -g typescript
