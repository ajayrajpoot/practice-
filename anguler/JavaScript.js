3.  What is JavaScript ?
    JavaScript is the most commonly used client-side scripting language. It is written into HTML documents to enable interactions with web pages in many unique ways. 
    As a relatively easy-to-learn language with pervasive support, it is well-suited to develop modern applications. 


Is JavaScript actually asynchronous?
    Javascript is the synchronous single-threaded language but with the help of event-loop and promises, JavaScript is used to do asynchronous programming.


Is JS for loop sync or async?
By default, the for loop is synchronous, meaning that each iteration will wait for the previous iteration to complete before starting. In this example, the loop starts with i equal to 1 and increments i by 1 each time through the loop until i is equal to 10.
