9. What are Directives in Angular?
    Directives are attributes that allow the user to write new HTML syntax specific to their applications. They execute whenever the Angular
    compiler finds them in the DOM. Angular supports three types of directives.  

    Component Directives
    Structural Directives
    Attribute Directives 

    Components—directives with a template. ...
Attribute directives—directives that change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.
Structural directives—directives that change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
