/**
 * Scalability differences
Vertical scaling: Because vertical scaling focuses on enhancing the storage and processing capabilities of one machine, there is a limit to how far these enhancements can be taken. This limit is determined by the specifications of the machine being enhanced. There are also limitations in the options provided by cloud providers meaning that you may only need 10% more resources but the next available tier may have 50% more resources for 50% more cost.

Horizontal scaling: Since horizontal scaling focuses on adding additional machines (e.g., scaling out), there is technically no limit to how far system enhancements can be taken. Of course, budget and system manageability are key factors to consider, but technically there is far more capacity within which to address organizational requirements.
