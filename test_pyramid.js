/**89. Define the concept of the test pyramid. Please explain the process of implementing them in terms of HTTP APIs.
 * 
The test pyramid is a concept that is often used in software testing to illustrate the ideal distribution of different types
 of tests. 
 The pyramid consists of three layers: 
 unit tests, 
 integration tests, and 
 end-to-end tests.
  The idea is that the majority of tests should be at the unit level, with fewer tests at the integration and end-to-end levels.

To implement the test pyramid in terms of HTTP APIs, you can start by writing unit tests for each endpoint in the API.
 These tests should focus on testing the functionality of the endpoint in isolation without making any external requests 
 or dependencies. Once the unit tests are passed, you can write integration tests that test the interaction between 
 different endpoints and components in the API. Finally, you can write end-to-end tests that test the entire API, 
 from the user interface to the database. */
