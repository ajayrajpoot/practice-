POST is used for creating or appending data to resources,
PUT is used for creating or replacing resources,

and PATCH is used for partially updating existing resources.

DELETE method targets a single resource, that resource is removed entirely.

GET, which returns a representational view of a resource's contents and data. 

GET should be used in read-only mode, which keeps the data safe and the resource idempotent. 
You should get the same results no matter how many times you use this method, unless it is modified by another 
client in the interim.
