/**
libuv is a C library that is used to abstract non-blocking I/O operations to a consistent interface across all supported platforms. 
It provides mechanisms to handle file system, DNS, network, child processes, pipes, signal handling, polling and streaming. 
It also includes a thread pool for offloading work 
for some things that can't be done asynchronously at the operating system level.
 

I/O operations ?
The I/O model in Node. js is a non-blocking event loop. This means that when you call a function that performs I/O, 
it will not block the execution of your code. Instead, it will return immediately and lets you continue executing other 
parts of your code while the I/O operation is performed in the background.
