/**
libuv is a C library that is used to abstract non-blocking I/O operations to a consistent interface across all supported platforms. 
It provides mechanisms to handle file system, DNS, network, child processes, pipes, signal handling, polling and streaming. 
It also includes a thread pool for offloading work 
for some things that can't be done asynchronously at the operating system level.
